# ⏱️ General Benchmarks
Repository containing benchmarks organized by feature. Each benchmark will contain its equivalent in different technologies. The benchmarks are not limited to a single programming language, or even to a single framework and are focused on general purpose.

## Benchmark Format
Each benchmark will be composing by the following parts:
- Briefly explanation about the benchmark objective
- Code that was used to gather the benchmark information
- Benchmark results table with data extracted from the code execution

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Benchmark methods can vary from benchmark to benchmark and will try to use the most reliable possible tools.
> Some benchmarks, mainly the specialized ones, are affected by cold starts and other variables so the methods
> used in them may also vary. We have a curated list of methods and tecniques that can be used to create a benchmark
> and it is listed below. It's important to note that the list can also vary with future updates.

## Contributing

You can contribute with meaningful benchmarks, fixes and suggestions to see a detailed information about contrbuting, click [here](CONTRIBUTING.MD). 

> [!TIP]
> Take care about you submissions, meaningful and concise benchmarks are valued and too sparse submissions won't be accepted. Try to explain the objective
> of the benchmark clearly.

> [!CAUTION]
> Benchmarks that depends on libraries, frameworks, external apis or any kind of dependency that is not present in the base runtime won't be accepted.
