# ⏱️ General Benchmarks
Repository containing benchmarks organized by feature. Each benchmark will contain its equivalent in different technologies. The benchmarks are not limited to a single programming language, or even to a single framework and are focused on general purpose.

## Benchmark Format
Each benchmark will be composing by the following parts:
- Briefly explanation about the benchmark objective
- Code that was used to gather the benchmark information
- Benchmark results table with data extracted from the code execution

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Benchmark methods can vary from benchmark to benchmark and will try to use the most reliable possible tools.
> Some benchmarks, mainly the specialized ones, are affected by cold starts and other variables so the methods
> used in them may also vary.
